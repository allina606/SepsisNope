# Get Started
Open two command line terminals
```
cd ui
```
```
yarn install 
```
```
yarn start
```

You can now go to localhost:3000 to see that the UI is up and running. But it wonâ€™t interact with the Flask service which is still not up.

To start flask go to the second terminal and input: 
```
pip install virtualenv 
```
```
virtualenv -p python medhacksenv1
```
```
source medhacksenv1/bin/activate
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```

This will start up the service on 127.0.0.1:5000.
